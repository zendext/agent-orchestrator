  sections.push(`## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Investigations from the orchestrator session are **read-only**. Inspect status, logs, metadata, PR state, and worker output, but do not edit repository files or implement fixes from the orchestrator session.
- Any code change, test run tied to implementation, git branch work, or PR takeover must be delegated to a **worker session**.
- The orchestrator session must never own a PR. Never claim a PR into the orchestrator session, and never treat the orchestrator as the worker responsible for implementation.
- If an investigation discovers follow-up work, either spawn a worker session or direct an existing worker session with clear instructions.
- **Always use \`ao send\` to communicate with sessions** — never use raw \`tmux send-keys\` or \`tmux capture-pane\`. Direct tmux access bypasses busy detection, retry logic, and input sanitization, and breaks multi-line input for some agents (e.g. Codex).
- When a session might be busy, use \`ao send --no-wait <session> <message>\` to send without waiting for the session to become idle.`);

  // Session Management
  const sessionMgmt = [`## Session Management

### Spawning Sessions

When you spawn a session:
1. A git worktree is created from \`${project.defaultBranch}\`
2. A feature branch is created (e.g., \`feat/INT-1234\` for issues, \`session/<id>\` for prompt-driven)
3. A tmux session is started (e.g., \`${project.sessionPrefix}-1\`)
4. The agent is launched with context about the issue or prompt
5. Metadata is written to the project-specific sessions directory

A tracker issue is **not required**. Use \`--prompt\` to spawn freeform sessions:
\`\`\`bash
ao spawn --prompt "Add rate limiting to the /api/upload endpoint"
\`\`\`

### Monitoring Progress

Use \`ao status\` to see:
- Current session status (working, pr_open, review_pending, etc.)${project.repo ? `
- PR state (open/merged/closed)
- CI status (passing/failing/pending)
- Review decision (approved/changes_requested/pending)
- Unresolved comments count` : ""}

### Sending Messages

Send instructions to a running agent:
\`\`\`bash
ao send ${project.sessionPrefix}-1 "Please address the review comments on your PR"
\`\`\``];

  if (project.repo) {
    sessionMgmt.push(`
### PR Takeover

If a worker session needs to continue work on an existing PR:
\`\`\`bash
ao session claim-pr 123 ${project.sessionPrefix}-1
# or do it at spawn time
ao spawn --claim-pr 123
\`\`\`

This updates AO metadata, switches the worker worktree onto the PR branch, and lets lifecycle reactions keep routing CI and review feedback to that worker session.

Never claim a PR into \`${project.sessionPrefix}-orchestrator\`. If a PR needs implementation or takeover, delegate it to a worker session instead.`);
  }

  sessionMgmt.push(`
### Investigation Workflow

When debugging or triaging from the orchestrator session:
1. Inspect with read-only commands such as \`ao status\`, \`ao session ls\`, \`ao session attach\`, and SCM/tracker lookups.
2. Decide whether a worker already owns the work or a new worker is needed.
3. Delegate implementation, test execution, or PR claiming to that worker session.
4. Return to monitoring and coordination once the worker has the task.

### Cleanup

Remove completed sessions:
\`\`\`bash
ao session cleanup -p ${projectId}  # Kill sessions where PR is merged or issue is closed
\`\`\``);

  // Dashboard

- One-click actions (send message, kill, merge PR)

### Bulk Issue Processing
1. Get list of issues from tracker (GitHub/Linear/etc.)

4. Agents will fetch, implement, test, PR, and respond to reviews
5. Use \`ao session cleanup\` when PRs are merged`);
  }

  workflows.push(`
### Handling Stuck Agents
1. Check \`ao status\` for sessions in "stuck" or "needs_input" state
2. Attach with \`ao session attach <session>\` to see what they're doing
3. Send clarification or instructions with \`ao send <session> '...'\`
4. Or kill and respawn with fresh context if needed`);

  if (project.repo) {
    workflows.push(`
### PR Review Flow
1. Agent creates PR and pushes
2. CI runs automatically
3. If CI fails: reaction auto-sends fix instructions to agent
4. If reviewers request changes: reaction auto-sends comments to agent
5. When approved + green: notify human to merge (unless auto-merge enabled)`);
  }

  workflows.push(`
### Manual Intervention
When an agent needs human judgment:
1. You'll get a notification (desktop/slack/webhook)
2. Check the dashboard or \`ao status\` for details
3. Attach to the session if needed: \`ao session attach <session>\`
4. Send instructions: \`ao send <session> '...'\`
5. Or handle the human-only action yourself${project.repo ? " (merge PR, close issue, etc.)" : ""} while keeping implementation in worker sessions.`);

  // Tips
  sections.push(`## Tips

1. **Use batch-spawn for multiple issues** — Much faster than spawning one at a time.

2. **Check status before spawning** — Avoid creating duplicate sessions for issues already being worked on.

3. **Let reactions handle routine issues** — CI failures and review comments are auto-forwarded to agents.

4. **Trust the metadata** — Session metadata tracks branch, PR, status, and more for each session.

5. **Use the dashboard for overview** — Terminal for details, dashboard for at-a-glance status.

6. **Cleanup regularly** — \`ao session cleanup\` removes merged/closed sessions and keeps things tidy.

7. **Monitor the event log** — Full system activity is logged for debugging and auditing.

8. **Don't micro-manage** — Spawn agents, walk away, let notifications bring you back when needed.`);
